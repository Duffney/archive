### What's a typical workweek look like?


 _Morning_

A typical workweek for me starts at around 6:00am Monday Morning. I zombie my way to the kitchen and make coffee. I LOVE coffee, so I spend the extra time and brew it with a Chemex. Making coffee easily takes around 10
minutes. I then down around 15 different vitamins with a glass of water and slowly mosey on up to my office. For the first hour or two of each workday I either work on my Pluralsight course, read twitter, catch up on slack or
look at mechanical keyboards online. Over the past few weeks I've been completely obsessed with mech keyboards, not sure why but I want like every keycap in the world! I recently started my collection with a WASD Code keyboard
as you can see in the above picture... and yes... those are PowerShell arrow keys! They were supposed to be the windows keys.. but I don't read things very carefully at times... After those first few hours I'm fully awake and
log into work. I refuse to check emails first so normally I look at tickets and the team's Kanban board for work. 

Once I've figured out what I'll be working on for the day I write it all down in my [Productivity Planner](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-productivity-planner). Using this has increased my focus by at least
+100 points. From 8:30am to 11:00am are my most productive hours of the day. I spend this time writing PowerShell automation of various sorts. During my "coding" time; I close email, sign out of Lync, stop looking at the ticket queue, and close misc browsers tabs to help me focus. I do leave slack open usually to ask people questions if I get stuck. Because I close emails, I always do my best to never schedule meetings in the morning. 

_Afternoon_

I eat lunch pretty early, usually around 11:00am to 11:30am. I'm informed of lunch either via text from my wife or my 2-year-old soon yelling "dada eat!" up the stairs at me. I have the privilege of working from home 100% of the time.
So each day I get to sit down with my family for lunch and dinner, which is amazing. I love working from home. It's pretty rare that I take a fully lunch. Most of the time I'm back upstairs hard at work by noon. Right after
lunch I check emails, tickets, messages etc... If there isn't anything urgent, I return to coding for another 2 hours before my productivity plummets at 2:00pm. For whatever reason, I hit a wall around 2:00pm, it's a good thing I have meetings around this time and I don't have to use my brain to much... lol

In between meetings I chat with co-workers and socialize a bit. In these less productive hours 2:00pm to 4:00pm, I'll also check social media and try to answer questions on slack and on forms. As well as, read blog posts or watch Pluralsight courses. My work day ends around 4:00pm.

_Evening_

If I'm working on a Pluralsight course, like I am right now 7:30pm to 11:00pm or 12:00pm is dedicated to working on the course. For the most part I really enjoy the process, but OMG is it time consuming! When I'm not working on a course
I'd play video games until I felt to guilty to play. Then I research new tech or learn something new technology related. I'll admit I don't have the best work life balance atm... it's a work in progress. The rest of the week is rinse repeat.

### What do you like the best about your role?

The amount of new things to learn. I'm now in a DevOps role, where my team is responsible for mainly software deployments among various other things. Pervious to this I was a windows sysadmin, it's a whole new world for me which
is exciting!

### What's something about you that no one knows?

Ever since I listened to the book [Mindset](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Mindset-Audiobook/B002V0QGLE), I've become fascinated with psychology. This has since lead me to read other psychology books like 
Grit, Give and Take, Originals and the tipping point. All of which have changed the way I think. 

### What do you listen to while you work?

### What do you wish you could change about your work?

Being able to turn it off. I'm lucky in the sense that I do what I love, but I have a really hard time turning it off. This causes two issues burn out and poor work life balance.

### Is there anything else you’d like to add that might be interesting to readers?

Focus on improving yourself, both intellectually and socially. It's far too easy to say someone else needs to change, but you really only ever have control over what you do. Work towards becoming the
best version of yourself every day and speak through actions not words. Also, if you do not already own a mechanical keyboard, buy one it will change your life!
