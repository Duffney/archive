Wow! It's been over a year since I wrote Detaching from Distractions. I'm taking this as an opportunity to take stock of my life and see what habits have stuck and which didn't over the past year. As well as share what I've learned, some of which might suprise you. I know it suprised me. I recently re-read Detacthing from Distraction and afterwards made the comment to my wife; "I'd really like to get back to that". As one could of predicted not all the habits stuck and the great pull of the digital world sucked me in further than I'd like to admit. But the first part of solving a problem is admitting you have one. It's been a year since I started my quest for a more linear mind and better mental health. But it's also been a year since I've done a lot of things; Blogging, Pluralsight course work and conference talks to name a few. To give full context of what I've learned I have to start by answering the question; "Where have I been?"

## Where I've been

I can easily say that the year 2018 was the highest point in my life both professionally and personally. But, as Isaac Newton would say _"What goes up must come down"_. And that was certianly true for me last year. Let's start at the beginning of the year, which started off great. At this time last year, I was already working hard on my PowerShell Summit 2018 presentation (_highest point in career_), well into my quest to remove distractions from my life, and my wife and I had found out she was pregnant with our second child. Fast forward a few months to April and there I was on a plane to the PowerShell Summit. 

Literally the first person I saw as I walked into the hotel lobby was Jeffery Snover! Then I looked over by the bar area and there stood pretty much every single person I admire in the PowerShell community. If I wasn't nervous already I certainly was now. Long story short, I got over my nerves eventually and had a great time at the conference. Meeting people I've knew for years online and who have helped me throughout my career was the best part. 

Shortly after I returned from the conference is when things started to go down hill, mainly my health. I started to have a lot of pain in my right foot. After several months of increasing levels of pain, I went to a podiatrist. Few more months of being in a boot and doing other things they recommended things only got worse. Not only that but I started to have a lot of digestive issues and was loosing a lot of weight. By this time, I could barely get through the day. I was going between three different doctors to try and figure out what was going on. 

## The Value of Distraction

It was during this time, that I realized the value of _"distractions"_. Distractions are how I pushed through each day. Needless to say all my new habits went right out the window. It was more of a survival mode than anything. My routine was basically pain medication, work, gaming, and watching TV. This type of routine minus the pain medication closely resembles my high school years, but as a husband and a father it left little time for my family. Luckily, I found a great GI doctor and got a diagnosis and with that diagnosis a treatment plan. I learned a valuable lesson, most things in life have a dichotomy that need to be balanced. This was a radical change for me because most of my life I've seen everything as black and white right and wrong. Distractions are no different they have their time and place. Their value is they let us forget about the present and mentally live somewhere else for awhile. This is clearly a double edge sword, that needs to be used wisely.

## Recovery

Recovery started in late August on a family road trip to Breckenridge Colorado. I really wanted my old life back, where I'd carry a physical book around the house rather than a phone. I wanted to stop running up stairs every chance I got to play video games and or binge on some YouTube videos. I wanted to be present again. I decided on that trip that it was time to get back on the path. Reading _The Shallows_ was what got me their the first time around, I hoped reading another such book could do it a second time. We stopped in Lincoln, NE on the way for lunch and I decided to go to Barnes and Noble and pick up a copy of _Deep Work by Cal Newport_. It had been on my to read list ever since I read _The Shallows_, but never got to it. 

I quickly realized how much my attention span had changed. I used to be able to read for one to two hours at a time, but now... I could hardly get through two to three pages before I had an itch to pickup my phone. I wish I could say I just willed myself to read the entire book on that trip, but the truth is I read maybe a chapter that entire week. I didn't retain much if any of it. It did however fuel my motivation to get back to where I was, which is what I really needed anyway. After I got back from vacation, I did end up finishing the book over a month or so. I also started a new habit of highlighting while reading and then taking notes from the highlights which really helped me retain the information. After reading the book I was a little overwhelmed. It had a lot of great advice, but I struggled to put it into action. I needed to reset and I decided to start with resetting my mornings.


## Reset

"It's time" I thought to myself. Time to start the 4:00am mornings again! If I'm going to get back on track my day needs to start on track. That means getting up early and working out. But 4:00am is pretty damn early, how do I do it? I've done it before, but this time I needed a little push. Luckly for me that push came from a comment on my blog. Luke left a book recommendation on my PowerShell Story Continued Becoming a Craftsman blog post. That book was the The Miracle Morning. It's a short read and I finished it in a week. To be honest, a lot of the content I had heard before or knew. However, it connected the information in a way that gave me a perspective that I didn't have before. It also gave me a protocol to follow, which was exactally what I needed. 

## My Morning Routine

* **Alarm:** 4:00am
* **Wakeup:** 4:00am-4:30am 
* **Gym:** 5:00am-6:00am
    * _four days a week 5-3-1 powerlifting program_
* **Reading & Writing:** 6:15am-7:00am
* **JiuJitsu**: 6:30am-7:30am
    * _two days a week_
* **Hang out with Kids:** 7:00am-8:00am
    * _My son's four, and we often play transformers :)_
* **Work:** 8:00am

In my opinion, having a good mornng routine makes everything else possible. If you're stuggling to find time to workout, read, write, or even sit in silence. Do yourself a favor and pickup The Miracle Morning. If your internal dialog just said "na, I'm not a morning person", ask yourself am I truely not a morning person or am I just unwilling to put in the work? You are not going to improve by doing everything the same. Mix it up a bit, give 4:00am a shot. 

In the last seven months my morning routine has enabled me to accomplish the following; gain thrity five pounds (it's a good thing), read six books, start to train jiu-jitsu, set life time personal records in powerlifting, start blogging again, start working on Pluralsight contacts, and be a better version of myself. I don't share this to brag, but to be a testiment of how powerful a morning routine can be. I mention a better version of myself, because I'm at the point now that my wife can tell if I wake up later than normal based on my mood. If I don't wake up and do something in the morning I'm typically more irritable. 

Allow me to throw in a disclamimer, the above outline is my average morning. I do have the occasional lapse, where I snooze my alarm and sleep until 5:00am or later. This especially happens on off-days at the gym and over weekends. I've noticed a few patterns that I'm working to correct. The theme seems to be when there is idle time or I do not have a plan for my time, it's easy to just go back to bed.

## Idle Unscheduled Time is a Way in for Weakness

The mornings that I snooze my alarm are the mornings that I don't have anything specific to do in the morning. It's some what comical, but I often fall back asleep trying to decide what I'll do after I wake up. On the rare occasion, that I will myself to wake up. I'll sit there for sometimes thirty minutes deciding what to do, annoying the sh!t out of myself. At times, I wont' be able to decide and I'll just grab my laptop or phone and browse... The two patterns I've recognzied are; When I don't have a plan for what to do the friction of figuring out what to do is to high and I'll go back to sleep. I'll also do this during the day wasting cycles trying to figure out what to do. Which normally leads to me mindlessly looking at my amazon wishlists...

I was recently reviewing my notes from Cal Newport's Deep Work book and was reminded of two of the conecpts in his book. Don't use the internet to entertain yourself and schedule every minute of your day. I hadn't realized how closely linked these two ideas are until now. When you stop using the internet to fill those idle moments it creates a void. This void plagues a person such as myself with the questions "What do I do right now? What's the best use of my time right now?" You see idle and or unscheduled time is a time of weakness for me. It's when I don't know what to do with my time that I decide to fall back asleep or binge on some tech. They say, you don't find time, you make time. But, I think I just found myself some squandered time and I'd like to make better use of. Another great note I took from Deep Work was "Think about the question, how do you want to spend your day within a day?" I think I can start to answer that question by scheduling every minute of my day. Perhaps not every minute, but I can at least start with every morning.

## Schedule Your Time

I do a pretty good job of managing my time at work. Every morning, I'll spend five to ten minutes writting down what I want to accomplsih through out the day inbetween meetings. I'll schedule deep work sessions for coding. I'll even spend sometime breaking down big projects into sub tasks or multiple cards in JIRA. But, when it comes to outside of work my day within a day I don't do any of that. If it isn't built into my routine it doesn't get done. Don't get me wrong I have a list of stuff that I want to do. Stuff like; clean the garage, learn aws, blog, hang garage ceiling storage, pay taxes, read, fix kitchen cupboard etc... These are the things that will endlessly rotate through my mind during my idle time. I don't want to forget them, but I also can't take action on them when I'm thinking about them. I had the same probelm with work tasks prior to putting more thought into planning my workday. So why not take what I've learned there and try and apply it to my leasiure time?

### Tactic One: The Shutdown Ritual

The shutdown ritual, is yet another thing I learned from Deep Work. The basic idea is you define a list of steps you take to end your work day on. My shutdown ritual is as follows:

1. Review to-dos (Jira & personal notebook)
2. Update to-dos & plan out tomorrow's work
3. Clean up desktop & setup apps for tomorrow's work
4. Lock laptop
5. Clean up desk and office
