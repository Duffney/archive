Finally! I got to attend the PowerShell Summit! It was also my first time speaking at a conference. I always knew that I would have to be a speaker in order to attend. It just never worked out in the past. Employers would either say there isn't enough in the training budget for you to go or hey, we don't have a training budget at all. That was the story I was told for the past four years. I know I could have always put up the cash to go, but I couldn't bring myself to do that. I had to take care of my family first. This year that changed and I'm really glad it did. I got so much out of my experience at the summit that I felt compelted to write about it. 

### Hotel Check-in

I had bumped an Uber from David Jones @BladeFireLight from the air port to the Marriot where we were staying. We arrived right has the mixer was ending and literaly the first person I saw as I'm walked into the hotel was Jeffery Snover! At first I froze, fighting my introverted instints and forced myself to stop as I did that my backpack which was slung across one shoulder shot to the ground. I quickly picked it up and b lined to Jeffery and introduced myself. Jeffery shook my hand as I introduced myself nervously. As he walked away I looked to my left and saw a huge group of people, all fellow PowerShell nerds.
