One of my favorite quotes is “Titles don’t matter, but the absolutely do matter.” Jeff Hackert said this on an Arrested DevOps episode titled Career Devops back in 2015. Titles don’t matter because they should never limit what you do, what you learn, and what you think you’re capable of. Titles do matter, because titles equate to how much you’re paid. Titles are also used to recognize experience and are the primary keywords used by recruiters when looking for candidates. To summarize, I’d say titles are situationally important. Whether they matter or not depends on the context of your situation. I believe the same is true for certifications. People view certifications very similar to titles. Some people think they are of the utmost importance. While others view them as worthless. As with any polarized view, the truth lies somewhere in between.

## Second
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
